Resources for new python users
------------------------------

.. admonition:: Coming soon.

   This section is under construction.

Section objectives:

- help those who have never used python before install python on their system, install pelicun and get started, assuming no prior experience
- include step-by-step instructions for a VS Code and Jupyter notebook setup (to help those who want to get started from scratch avoid having to navigate external links), but mention we don't endorse any specific editor
- mention where to get help (past NHERI Symposium recordings and other available material we have)
