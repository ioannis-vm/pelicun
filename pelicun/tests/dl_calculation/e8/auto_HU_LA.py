def auto_populate(aim: dict) -> tuple[dict, dict, pd.DataFrame]:
    """
    Populates the DL model for hurricane assessments in Atlantic County, NJ.

    Assumptions:
    - Everything relevant to auto-population is provided in the Building
    Information Model (AIM).
    - The information expected in the AIM file is described in the parse_GI
    method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    AIM: dictionary
        Contains the information that is available about the asset and will be
        used to auto-popualate the damage and loss model.

    Returns
    -------
    GI_ap: dictionary
        Contains the extended BIM data.
    DL_ap: dictionary
        Contains the auto-populated loss model.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
      If the building class is not recognized.
